<P> MOBILE LEGEND:<P>
<P>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones (but also can be played on the PC with an Android/iOS emulator). The two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own base for control of a path, the three "lanes" known as "top", "middle" and "bottom", which connects the bases.In each team, there are five players who each control an avatar, known as a "hero", from their own device. Weaker computer-controlled characters, called "minions", spawn at team bases and follow the three lanes to the opposite team's base, fighting enemies and turrets.
<P>MY INTEREST: to be a rank 1 player in the world i know their are many pro gamers but i will do my best to get in the top.<P>
